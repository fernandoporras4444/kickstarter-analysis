# Kickstarter Analysis

## Kickstarter Data Overview: 
Project overview was to perform analysis on Kickstarter dataset and 
determine the best outcome for when a theater play should be launched along with fundraising success. 

## Analysis and challenges: 
I was able to use the Kickstarter dataset and create a pivot chart from 
information based on the years (2009-2017) and category (theater) to determine the best outcome of 
when to launch the play. I was also able to use information from the goals column and determine how 
many plays that were successful, failed, or canceled from a fundraising aspect.

## Results: 
Two conclusions were drawn from the Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date pivot chart 
with eight years of collected data. First conclusion indicates the month of May is the most likely 
successful time to launch to play, and second conclusion based on trend lines indicates least likely 
to succeed in the months from October to December.

The conclusion from the Outcomes Based on Goals line chart indicates most successful between less 
than $1,000 to $15,000 range and $35,000 to $45,000 range in goals.

Limitations of the data sets are no subcategories to Outcomeâ€™s column for successful, failed, and 
canceled help understand the reasoning of why it was successful, failed, or canceled.

Create other tables or graphs would be a bar chart showing the goal values versus pledge values along 
with along with year and country filters to help determine when and where to launch the play.
